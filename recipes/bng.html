    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Whether it is for breakfast, lunch, or dinner - biscuits and gravy is the perfect choice to be satified and full.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p><ul>
            <li>1/2 lb pork sausage</li>
            <li>1.5 Tbsp butter</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp crushed red pepper</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
        </ul></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Add the pork sausage to a skillet and cook over medium heat, breaking it into chunks as you stir, until it is cooked through. Do not drain the fat from the skillet.<br><br></li>
            <li>Add the butter and flour to the skillet with the pork. Continue to stir and cook for about 2 minutes more.<br><br></li>
            <li>Whisk the milk into the skillet, making sure to dissolve all the browned bits off the bottom of the skillet as you whisk. Continue to stir and cook until the milk begins to simmer lightly, at which point it will thicken into a nice gravy (5 minutes).<br><br></li>
            <li>Season the gravy with red pepper, freshly cracked black pepper, garlic powder, and salt. Serve over biscuits or your favorite starchy breakfast item.</li>
